# Stay Hydrated

Let's build a tiny frontend application using Flutter, and a Dart backend that will periodically check our Firestore database and notify users to drink water.

The libraries we'll be using are listed below:

- Flutter - https://flutter.dev/
- Firebase Auth, Messaging, Admin SDK - https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview
- Shelf - https://pub.dev/packages/shelf
